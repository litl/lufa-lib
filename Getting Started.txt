--------------------------------------------
  GENERAL INFORMATION:
--------------------------------------------

This library is currently in its development stages and thus is not complete in several areas. For the latest documentation, check out the project entry on the Four Walled Cubicle site Wiki, at http://wiki.fourwalledcubicle.com.

For code updates, be sure to visit my website, at http://www.fourwalledcubicle. MyUSB developments are frequently discussed on my development blog, at http://blog.fourwalledcubicle.com


If you have Programmer's Notepad installed (which ships with the latest WinAVR), you can open up the included .pnproj file to view the entire library and demonstration applications easily.


To compile and use this library, you will need the latest version of WinAVR, avaliable from http://winavr.sourceforge.net.


A number of library demonstration applications are included, in the Demos/ directory. Some of these are contributed or modified by persons other than myself - check the comments at the top of each demonstration application source file.


--------------------------------------------
  BUILDING:
--------------------------------------------

To build each demonstration application individually, run a "make all" from the project's subdirectory in the Demos/ directory. You can also build all demonstration applications at once by executing a "make all" from the Demos/ directory.

To build the Helper applications (small Java tools used to perform MyUSB related development tasks such as determine which events in the library are not hooked in a particular user application) you will need to have the latest JDK installed. Run "make all" from the MyUSB/HelperApps/ subdirectory to build all the tools at once.

To build the helper applications and run the Helper applications which operate on the whole library (and any other library-related operations), execute a "make all" from the MyUSB/ directory.

A makefile is present in the root of the project folder; this will perform all the above tasks in sequence when called with "make all".

A "make clean" is also accepted by all makefiles, to remove the compiled/output/binary files.
